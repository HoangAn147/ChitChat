# ChitChat
   In my project ChitChat, I developed a real-time chat application using Firebase Realtime Database and Firebase Authentication. 
Users can register, log in, and send messages to each other in real time. I implemented message synchronization, user lists, and 
chat interfaces using RecyclerView and ViewHolder patterns. I also handled user presence and message delivery efficiently. Through 
this project, I learned how to structure an Android app with Firebase backend and improve UI responsiveness for real-time communication.
